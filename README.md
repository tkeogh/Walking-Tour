# Walking-Tout

Code completed for group project in second year.

Android project that allows a user to plot a walk, including points of interest and images relating to them
and have it sent off as a JSON for dealing with.

No server sided code was completed by me. 

Tests in this project were completed by somebody else, all other code is mine.
